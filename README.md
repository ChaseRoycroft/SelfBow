# SelfBow
Calculating various characteristics for a wooden self bow, modeled as a thin elastic rod with circular cross section, in the "pure bending" limit where the bent shape is circular instead of an elastica. Currently, the range is much too high -- I think the lack of tapering of the cross section is at least part of the problem. Later, it would be nice to also plot the values for the elastica (without the circular limit assumption) for comparison. Note that the variable "a" is half the central angle of the bow.
